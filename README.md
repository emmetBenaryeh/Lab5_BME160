# Lab5_BME160
This project includes a class sequence analysis containing several powerful tools not utilzed in the lab. For a detailed description of the sequence analysis code look to my repository for sequence analysis. Lab 5 is designed to find all possible ORF in a sequence of DNA,the findORFs class accepts several parameters as options: an optional minimum sequence length, an option to only return the longest possible ORF per each stop codon, a list of possible start codons, and a list of possible stop codons.
